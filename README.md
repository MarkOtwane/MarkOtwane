- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" in computer programming originated from an actual insect? In 1947, when computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer, she famously taped it to a logbook and noted, "First actual case of bug being found." And that's how the term "debugging" came to be! 🐛🖥
