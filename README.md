Fun Fact
Did you know the term **"bug"** in computer programming originated from an actual insect? 🐛  
In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team discovered a moth causing issues in the Harvard Mark II computer. They taped it to the logbook and labeled it as the *“first actual case of a bug being found”*. And just like that, "debugging" was born!
